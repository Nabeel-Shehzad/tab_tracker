3. **Content Context Analysis**: Finding emails in contact sections
4. **Domain-Based Extraction**: Extracting admin@, info@, contact@ emails

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections
- **DNS Caching**: Cache DNS lookups to avoid repeated queries
- **Bulk Database Operations**: Batch inserts for better performance
- **Memory Management**: Automatic garbage collection
- **Request Throttling**: Respect server limits and avoid blocking

## 🔒 Ethical Considerations

- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Respects robots.txt directives
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents overwhelming target servers
- **Public Data Only**: Extracts only publicly available information
- **No Authentication Bypass**: Does not attempt to bypass login systems

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**MySQL Connection Failed**
```bash
# Check XAMPP MySQL service
# Verify database credentials in common/config_mysql.php
```

**No Workers Started**
```bash
# Check if ports are available
# Verify PHP CLI is accessible
scraping.bat status
```

**Low Performance**
```bash
# Install Redis for better performance
# Increase PHP memory limit
# Check internet connection speed
```

**Memory Issues**
```bash
# Reduce batch size in scraping_config.php
# Add more workers with smaller batches
# Monitor with scraping.bat status
```
